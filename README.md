## [Truck's operational distance logger](https://github.com/hkbtotw/Android_AzureCS_BatchRead_v2)

**Why?**
In logistics, cost management is one of the key performance indicator which management needs to keep monitoring and optimizing to drive the business to success. Oftentime, the problem in acheiving this goal is inability to obtain high quality operational information and the truck's operational distance is one good example of such information that could impact the transportation cost directly. However, getting the covered traveling distance is not easy as most companies rely on driver to input this information on either paper form or online data entry application in which the data can be easily manipulted for any other kind of reasons but the benefits of the company.

**Solution:**
This application was developed to help increasing the quality of transportation data by trying to removing human factor from inputting data the system. 
In this application, the mile number shown in truck dashboard will be extracted by OCR and the data will be logged into the parse server for analyzing and other analytical activities. Additionally, it could help providing driver a feedback to each's daily operation with which driver could improve the driving behavior and plan to support the cost optimizaton and SLA goals.

## [Truck driver's driving behavior monitoring](https://github.com/hkbtotw/DriveBehavior)

**Why?**
In logistics, delivery on-time is one of the major SLA which the business needs to fulfill this promise to their customers. Therefore, ability to track the status of each delivery and the driving behavior (e.g. speed ) of each truck driver is the leading indicator to this particular KPI.

**Solution:**
This application was developed as a protoytpe of the truck driver's driving behavior and delivery status monitoring.

**Technology**
- **Amazon EC2**  _Parse Server_
- **Google** Google Map api
- **Android Application Development**
